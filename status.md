Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I haven't done a whole lot as of now as I was busy with a calc exam.  So far, all I've done is write the base code which starts the game and gets the turtle to fire at unmoving targets.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not done a majority of the detailed aspects.  I still need to learn how to have the game save, how to import avatars, how to have all of the avatars interact, 
how to get the score to count, and a few other smaller things.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I haven't had any serious problems as of yet that were not able to be solved by looking back at previous labs and online.
