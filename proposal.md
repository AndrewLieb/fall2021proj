# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Galaga Remastered 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I plan on remaking Galaga in python.  I plan to allow players to change what their weapons shoot, the enemies, and allow them to save their progress. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I plan on remaking galaga as it was(or still is) with some added on bonuses.  Some of these include adding customizebale aspects such as the projectiles fired, the space ship, the enemies, the background, the sound effects, and allowing them to pause their progress.
In practice it will begin with the player controlling the craft with their arrow keys and firing at the enemies which approach from the top of the screen.  For each enemy destoryed they will gain points and if they're hit they will lose a life(out of three).  
The only difference from the original is that before the game starts, players will be able to customize thier experience. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am not. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Hopefully my final project will do all of the things I listed in the first part of the proposal.  I know I will be able to accomplish the base game, however after some brief research into the project I can tell it will be difficult to add cutomizable cosmetics as well as save files that stay on someones device.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be the base game as well as allowing players to change certain aspects of how the game looks.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be a game that is not only galaga, but builds off of the original game allowing players to change their experience while playing(potentially even importing their own avatars?).

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The new skills I will learn include importing different textures and graphics into python.  I will need to learn how to assign controls to arrow keys as well as getting user input and implementing it more so then just users letters or numbers.  
I will also need to learn how to allow user to pause the game so that their progress is not lost. I also need to learn how to get the onscreen graphics to interact and disappear when needed.  
Essentially, I need to learn everything that this project intails as I have little to no experience, aside from turlte graphics, doing somehting like this in python.
