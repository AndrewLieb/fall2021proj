# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I was thinking about creating a discord bot, making a simple game like 
hangman, minesweeper, or somehting else of that nature, or something that 
has to do more with harware than software. 

After some more thinking, I like the idea of making Galaga in python, with customasizable enemies and lasers as well as seperate save file. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to work alone. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

None.
